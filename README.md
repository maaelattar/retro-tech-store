## Reflection

This is not a fully featured website. It's a side project for the purpose of developing an e-commerce web application.

Right now admin can add products with its name, price, image and description
and users can view products and filter them to find what best match their needs

Users can add products to their shopping cart and checkout their order.

I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router-5.2` and `tailwindcss`.

I used strapi headless CMS for backend development.

As this website is for development purposes only users can not add their address and they don't get actual products as they are not real.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are:

- React
- React-Router-Dom 5.2
- TailwindCSS
- Axios
- react-icons
- Stripe Payment Service
- Strapi Headless CMS
